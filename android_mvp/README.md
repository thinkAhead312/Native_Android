## MVP
The Video listing app is based on model view presenter pattern.

###### model
The model is responsible to provide list of videos as per the contract(through the interface) between the model and presenter.

###### presenter
The presenter has all the business logic and is also responsible for the communication between the model and the view such as the any video addition or deletion

###### view
The view is the layout view of the video listing.

any of three component are easy replacable, also any change in one component of the application does not impact any other component in the application due to clean separation of roles.
